# Kristin Evans | Capstone Portfolio

👋 Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio!

This repository showcases my Capstone project. I'm passionate about technology, security, and building systems that are both powerful and user-friendly. This is a living portfolio that will continue to grow as I add more projects throughout the term.

## 📌 Capstone Project: Website Security Research Project 

### 🚀 Overview
This project involves identifying, testing, and documenting common web application vulnerabilities using the OWASP Juice Shop platform. I explored real-world scenarios like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Broken Authentication, then documented fixes and recommendations for improving security posture. The goal was to simulate the role of a security analyst working on a live application.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python (for scripting + automation)
- 💻 JavaScript & HTML/CSS (front-end testing and inspection)
- 🛡️ OWASP Juice Shop (vulnerable app for ethical hacking practice)
- 📊 GitHub Projects (issue tracking and sprint planning)
- ⚙️ OpenSSL & CLI tools (testing encryption and secure headers)
- 🧰 Burp Suite & Wireshark (penetration testing & traffic inspection)
